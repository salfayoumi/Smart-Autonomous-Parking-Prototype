# Smart-Autonomous-Parking-Prototype
Smart Autonomous Parking Prototype using Arduino Uno

What I Did
This project is a personal adaptation of a public open-source idea. I forked and modified it to explore:

- Real-time parking slot detection using IR sensors

- Automated signaling with LED indicators

- Space tracking logic on Arduino Uno

- Custom improvements and documentation


Features
- Detects available parking spaces using IR proximity sensors

- Displays the number of free slots via LCD

- Uses LEDs to indicate open/occupied slots

- Simple simulation of real-world smart parking solutions

- Code structured for easy adaptation and testing


Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno

- IR Sensors × 3

- LEDs × 3

- 16x2 LCD

- Jumper wires, Breadboard, Power supply
